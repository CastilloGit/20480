                DRAG DROP
                You are implementing a web worker by using JavaScript and HTML5. The web worker processes a longrunning loop and returns the result to a webpage.
                The web worker is defined on the webpage as follows:

                var myWorker = new Worker('task.js');
                myWorker.postMessage({message:'go', iterations: 1000000000});
            
                        You have the following requirements:
                                Evaluate the message value in the web worker.
                                Process the loop based on the iterations value that is passed from the webpage.
                                Return a value back to the webpage from the web worker.
                                You need to implement the web worker.

                        How should you complete the relevant code? To answer, drag the appropriate code segments to the correct
                        targets. Each code segment may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the
                        split bar between panes or scroll to view content.
