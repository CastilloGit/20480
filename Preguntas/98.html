    A company asks you to create a function that displays loan amounts to their customers.
    You must create the function by using JavaScript to meet the following requirements:

    Display three different loan amounts to each customer.

    Display loan amounts in order starting with the greatest amount and ending with the least amount.

    You need to implement the function.

    How should you complete the relevant code? To answer, drag the appropriate commands to the correct

    Correct answer:

    function showLoanAmounts(){
        var loanAmount = 400;

            function showSomeLoanAmount(){
                var loanAmount = 800;

                function showAnotherLoanAmount(){
                    var loanAmount = 1000;
                    alert(loanAmount);
                }
                showAnotherLoanAmount();
                alert(loanAmount);
            }
            showSomeLoanAmount();
            alert(loanAmount);
    }
